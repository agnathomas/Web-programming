<p>1100 meters above sea, far way from the loud city culture, lush greenery and serenity to gift every visitor, Vagamon could be your quiet offbeat hill station in Kerala away from maddening tourist crowds. If you are a forest lover, the first place you should visit in Vagamon is the Vagamon Pine forest, which is the major tourist attraction of this place. A very popular spot for movie shootings, Vagamon forest is actually a man-made forest which was created during the British era. The forest overlooks the entire Vagamon valley and is a beautiful place where you can go for a long walk, or just sit under a pine tree and breathe in the fresh mountain air.</p>
